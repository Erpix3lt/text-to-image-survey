        Digital fashion is the approach of moving fashion into the digital space. Famous examples are Balenciaga creating their own game or Fortnite collaborating with Luxury Brands. <br><br> 
        But Digital Fashion goes beyond that. It is not limited by the resources and physics of the analogue world. 
        <br>3D Editors, as well as artificial intelligence might be used to create digital fashion.
