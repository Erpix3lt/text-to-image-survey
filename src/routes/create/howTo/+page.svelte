      For my bachelor thesis I am asking you, to create a <b>Digital clothing item</b>. Something you would want to be existing.<br /> In order to do so, we are using DALL E, a neural network
      translating text into images. On the next slide you can see some examples of text being translated into Digital Art.<br />
      I am not showing you Digital Clothes on purpose, hoping not to influence your creativity.
